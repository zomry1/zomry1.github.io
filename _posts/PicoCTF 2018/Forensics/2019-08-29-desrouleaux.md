## Challenge

>Our network administrator is having some trouble handling the tickets for all of of our incidents. Can you help him out by answering all the questions? Connect with `nc 2018shell.picoctf.com 14079`.

### Hint
> If you need to code, python has some good libraries for it.

## Solution

So.. I hate those challenges in picoCTF because if you want the user to really write a script to pass the challenge, do it with time limit or many questions, but those challenges can be solved by hand, and this is how I did this challenge so there is nothing to show you here.

If still you want to solve this with script, I recommend on python with the "json" module of course.
