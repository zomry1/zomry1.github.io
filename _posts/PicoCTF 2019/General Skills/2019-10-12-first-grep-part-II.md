## Challenge

> What does this `bDNhcm5fdGgzX3IwcDM1` mean? I think it has something to do with bases.

### Hint

> Submit your answer in our competition's flag format. For example, if you answer was 'hello', you would submit 'picoCTF{hello}' as the flag.

## Solution

So common 'Base' that used in CTF challenges is 64Base, I used this site to decode the text
[here](https://www.base64decode.org/) and found the flag!

## Flag
> `picoCTF{l3arn_th3_r0p35}`
