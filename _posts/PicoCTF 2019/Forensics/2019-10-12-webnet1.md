Recover the flag. You can also find the file in /problems/webnet1_0_d63b267c607b8fedbae100068e010422.

Submit!
 
### Hint

> Try using a tool like Wireshark
> How can you decrypt the TLS stream?

## Solution

I just did the same I did in the WebNet0 [Add Link] but now I couldnt see the flag immediatly so I pipe the output to file:

    ssldump -r capture.pcap -k picopico.key -d > output

Now open the file in a text editor:
![Text editor](https://i.imgur.com/4MfjfWY.png)
and just Ctrl+f and search the pico format:
![Not a flag](https://i.imgur.com/40uYX5M.png)
But as it says it's not the flag :-(
continue to the next found, and the next... and the next and found this:
![The flag](https://i.imgur.com/74lsEZa.png)
And we found the flag!
