## Let's Start
We start with checking our IP address with:

    ifconfig

![Ifconfig](https://i.imgur.com/TqP6eEm.png)

Our IP is:

> 192.168.1.39

Now open ***Zenmap*** (nmap GUI verison),
and do a "Quick Scan" for the IP "192.168.1.*"  ( * symbolize for every number)
![Zenmap](https://i.imgur.com/hSO3R9b.png)
So the target IP is

> 192.168.1.40

And we have a http port and ssh port open.
So at first let's check the web server through ***FireFox***.
![Web Page](https://i.imgur.com/LMHjil7.png)

But there is nothing in those pages or in the pages source.

Let's try to check what we have on the web server with ***Nikto***

    nikto -h 192.168.1.40

We can see some folders so we need to check them.
*admin* folder.

We can see a txt file so open it.

There is a password there

> 12345ted123

Let's keep searching in the other folders.
*mail* folder.

Open the php file.
![Php File](https://i.imgur.com/Ntg1OW3.png)
*img* folder.
![img folder](https://i.imgur.com/YALrLv8.png)
All the images look normal, so what we have?
we know that the password is

> 12345ted123

and that there is a open port for ssh.
So let's try to connect to the ssh, but we need a username...
Maybe, it's *ted* from the password.

    ssh ted@192.168.1.40
    yes
    12345ted123

Now we are in, go to out from the folders

    cd ..

lets search for files that has root permission

    find / -type f -user root -perm /u+s -ls 2> /dev/null
Let's break it down

 - **find** - command for search something
 - **/** - to search in all the files system
 - **-type f** - search for files
 - **-user root** - the owner of the file (here is root)
 - **-perm /u+s** - files that have the permission of their owner
 - **-ls** - list the files in ls format
 - **2> /dev/null** - to avoid "permission denied "messages
![Find Files](https://i.imgur.com/oV99RjW.png)

We can see that python is one of those files that as u+s permission therefore, if we use python we have a root permission (python owner is root).
We can use this to get our root privilege.
We can do this by python that import *pty*, this package can start process ,one of them is a shell.

    python -c 'import pty; pty.spawn("/bin/sh");'
   Let's break it
   

 - **python** -  we want to use python.
 - **-c** - (flag) that this is a python in this command.
 - **import pty** - import that package.
 - **pty.spawn("/bin/sh")**- create process of TTY shell.

Now that we have root privilege, we can go to root folder.

    cd root

And there look for the files in it.

    ls

We can see file with the name *flag.txt*, read it

    cat flag.txt
    
And we done.

## The flag is:
